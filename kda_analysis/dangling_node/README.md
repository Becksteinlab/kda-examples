## Dangling Node Analysis

Notebooks used for analyzing "dangling node" and "parallel node" cases for simple 3 state models.

The **dangling node** case observes changes in the state probabilities and net cycle flux (for the Hamiltonian cycle) by adding a single "dangling node" outside of the cycle.

The **parallel node** case observes changes in the net cycle flux (for the Hamiltonian cycle) as a result of adding a node _in parallel_ to another within the original cycle.
